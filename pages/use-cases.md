* Comprehensive Literature Review
* Dataset Utilization
* Approaching New Datasets
* Generating New Research Applications   

We fully expect that DUOS will be used in conjunction with already
existing resources such as JSTOR, Web of Science by Thomson Reuters,
and Google Scholar.  Depending on the particular task, DUOS can be
used before, after, or alongside any of these research resources.
